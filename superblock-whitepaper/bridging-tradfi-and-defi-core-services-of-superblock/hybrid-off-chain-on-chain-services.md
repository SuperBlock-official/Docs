# Hybrid Off-Chain/On-Chain Services

Incorporating hybrid services allows SuperBlock to optimize for both efficiency and security.

* **Hybrid Reporting and Auditing:** Off-chain data analysis and reporting (e.g., detailed performance metrics) are conducted off-chain, while key financial indicators and audit results are stored on-chain.
* **Cross-Border Transactions (RegTech):** Off-chain regulatory data sources are used to verify compliance before triggering on-chain settlement in multiple jurisdictions, ensuring frictionless global transactions.
