# Asset Tokenization

* **Token Creation and Management:** Essential for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate, securities, or commodities. Each token represents fractional ownership and can be securely transferred and traded on the blockchain.
* **Fractional Ownership Representation:** On-chain tracking of ownership, ensuring transparency in transactions and fractionalization, critical for appealing to both retail and institutional investors.
