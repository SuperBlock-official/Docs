# DeFi Protocols for TradFi Integration

* **Lending and Borrowing Services (TradFi-DeFi Blend):** Enable tokenized real-world assets to be used as collateral for loans or yield generation via staking. This blends traditional lending practices with DeFiâ€™s efficiency and accessibility.
* **Tokenized Asset-Backed Loans:** Allow investors to use tokenized assets as collateral for obtaining liquidity in decentralized markets, reflecting a more familiar TradFi use case but with decentralized benefits.
