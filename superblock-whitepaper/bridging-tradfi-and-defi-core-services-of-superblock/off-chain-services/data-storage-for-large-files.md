# Data Storage for Large Files

* **Decentralized Off-Chain Storage (IPFS, Filecoin):** Large documents like property deeds, legal contracts, or compliance certificates can be stored off-chain. Only the hash or proof of existence is kept on-chain, reducing storage costs and optimizing performance.
* **Off-Chain Reporting for Tokenized Assets:** Financial reports, asset performance data, or rental income summaries can be generated off-chain, with key indicators or final results published on-chain.
