# Asset Valuation, Due Diligence, and Verification

* **Off-Chain Real Estate/Asset Valuation:** Partner with third-party appraisers or auditors for real estate and other RWA evaluations, feeding results into the blockchain as verifiable data.
* **Off-Chain Compliance Audits:** Financial and legal compliance processes (KYC, AML, taxation) can be handled off-chain, while only final proofs or audit hashes are recorded on-chain for transparency.
