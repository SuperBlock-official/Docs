# KYC/AML Compliance Services

* **Off-Chain Identity Verification (KYC/AML):** User identity and anti-money laundering checks can be conducted off-chain by regulated service providers. The on-chain system will only store verified status, keeping user privacy intact.
* **Off-Chain Continuous Monitoring:** Regular compliance checks (e.g., monitoring transaction patterns for suspicious activity) can occur off-chain, feeding alerts into the on-chain system if necessary.
