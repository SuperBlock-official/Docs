# Portfolio and Asset Management

* **Off-Chain Portfolio Tools:** Offer users a user-friendly dashboard where they can track the performance of their tokenized assets or investment portfolios. The on-chain component only reflects key actions like buying or selling tokens.
* **Real Estate/Property Management:** For real estate tokens, off-chain property management services can handle daily operations (rent collection, maintenance), with revenue streams reflected on-chain.
