# Oracle Services

* **Off-Chain Price Feeds:** Use decentralized oracles to bring external asset prices, interest rates, and financial data into the blockchain for smart contract operations, ensuring that DeFi services like collateral lending are based on real-time data.
* **Oracles for TradFi Market Data:** Integrate traditional financial data (e.g., stock prices, market indices) into the blockchain through oracles to support sophisticated tokenized financial products.
